1. The appointment screen itself is fairly transparent - difficult to see.  
2. The Appointment screen look a lot like OpenEMR's.  Can we change the looks to our own creative tailwind css?
3. Cannot edit an existing appointment
4. Cannot set the correct amount of time for the appointment.
5. The + New Appointment button on the front Dashboard does not work, yet.

Questions: 
How are we going to see if a clinician is available at that time?
What if the appointment is made on a holiday or day the office is closed, or if the clinician is unavailable?
